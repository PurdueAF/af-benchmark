**üèóÔ∏è Work in progress üöß**


This benchmark is designed for generic but comprehensive performance tests of the computing infrastructure at CMS Analysis Facilities. It currently includes the following functionality:

* Multiple options for code execution:

  * Sequential
  * Parallelized via ``concurrent.futures``
  * Parallelized via ``Dask`` using local cluster
  * Parallelized via ``Dask`` using Gateway cluster

* Multiple data access options:

  * Explicit list of files or directories in local or mounted filesystem
  * List of files, blocks, or datasets at CMS DBS accessed via network, e.g. XRootD or XCache

* Loading and reading columns from NanoAOD ROOT files is done using ``uproot``.

* Abstract "operation" with a given timeout executed by workers to emulate data processing during analysis. 

* Time profiling
* Measuring size of columns in bytes
