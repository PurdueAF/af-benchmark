**üèóÔ∏è Work in progress üöß**


This benchmark is designed for generic but comprehensive performance tests of the computing infrastructure at CMS Analysis Facilities. It currently includes the following functionality:

* Multiple options for code execution:

  * Sequential
  * Parallelized via ``concurrent.futures``
  * Parallelized via ``Dask`` using local cluster
  * Parallelized via ``Dask`` using Gateway cluster

* Multiple methods of loading and reading columns from NanoAOD ROOT files:

  * ``uproot``
  * ``coffea.nanoevents``

* Generic operations applied to data in columns:

  * Nothing (just open the ROOT file with a given method)
  * Load column data into memory
  * Perform a simple operation on a column, e.g. ``mean()``

* Time profiling
* Measuring size of columns in bytes
